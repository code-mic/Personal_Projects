    "As we can see, our estimation was correct where if we removed those apps that generate more than 100,000,000 installs it is around a 10 times difference compare to if we didn't remove it. This will be a slightly hard to build an app for this market as there are already giants that have been estabilshed. But not to say that it will be hard because if it were to be successful a huge number of people could convert to using this app. For example with the introduction of Discord I believe there has been a huge reduction in people using Skype and with Zoom also being introduced into the mix it made it even harder for Skype to come back.\n",
